Possible future improvements:
=============================

* possibility to compare section names in case-insensitive manner

* possibility to compare key names in case-insensitive manner

* possibility to compare values in case-insensitive manner

* possibility to detect lines that contain both data and comments, e.g.

    key = value ; comment here

  and leave the comment part out of the value
